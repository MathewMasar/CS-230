The Gaming Room was the client for this project, needing help to modernize their Android based game Draw It or Lose It into a web based, cross platform application. They required a system that could handle multiple games, teams, and players simultaneously while also ensuring that names were unique and the application would be easily scalable. The software was designed using Java and object oriented principles like Singleton and Iterator to manage game services and enforce uniqueness in variables. 
One thing that I did well was mapping the clients' needs directly into the design. Working through the design document helped break down the project into clear, manageable parts and made the coding phases much easier. A complete system architecture diagram would be best to visualize how all components interact. A heavy focus was placed on scalability, responsiveness, and cost efficiency, which is how things would be in a real world job scenario. Considering user needs is crucial because it ensures the finished product is functional, user friendly, and aligned with business goals.  
While approaching the design I used techniques like domain modeling, modular organization, and design pattern application early on. IN future projects I would continue this approach but also integrate more visual tools like UML diagrams to improve communication and better anticipate the interactions in complex systems.
